## Hi there, I'm Romain! 👋
**Web Developer | Tea Aficionado**

### 🧑‍💻 About Me
I’m Romain, your friendly neighborhood web developer.
But wait, there’s more! I’m also a certified master tea sommelier. Yes, you read that right – I can both code a website and brew the perfect cup of tea.
Over the past decade, I’ve transformed from a musician to a master tea sommelier to a web developer. What can I say? I like to keep things interesting.

When I'm not reading docs or pouring tea, you can find me hiking through nature or savoring a glass of natural wine.

### ☕ Tea Time
Not only can I develop slick web applications, but I can also brew the perfect cup of tea.
Fancy a cup while you browse my projects? Let’s chat about the intricate flavors of a raw Sheng or the savory umami of a Gyokuro.
