# Hi there, I'm Romain! 👋
**Web Developer | Tea Aficionado**

### 🧑‍💻 About Me
I’m Romain, your friendly neighborhood web developer.  
But wait, there’s more! I’m also a certified master tea sommelier.  
Yes, you read that right – I can both code a website and brew the perfect cup of tea.  
Over the past decade, I’ve journeyed from being a musician to a master tea sommelier to a web developer.  
What can I say? I like to keep things **interesting**.  

When I'm not reading docs or pouring tea, you can find me hiking through nature or savoring a glass of natural wine.

### ☕ Tea Time
While summertime's going crazy all around the world ☀️, you have to try a koridashi brewing method.  
Brought from Japan 🗾, you just have to let some ice melt on top of your favorite tea.  
This gets wild if you use this with some chinese black tea.
